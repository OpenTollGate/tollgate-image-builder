It appears this error is caused by the image generation process running out of space or crossing some size limit specific to your GL-AR300M16 target. Even though the whoami module itself seems small, it likely pulls in the Go runtime (or additional libraries) large enough to push the firmware image over the deviceâ€™s capacity or trigger a size-related constraint.

## Possible Reasons

- The addition of the whoami module leads to a firmware that becomes too large for the GL-AR300M16 build profile.
- Some packages with significant dependencies (like Go-based IPKs) inflate the size, even if the source code is minimal.
- Limited flash layout constraints on the GL-AR300M16 cause the sysupgrade creation to fail when the image is too large or the partition boundaries are exceeded.

## Potential Solutions

- Remove Unused Packages  
If there are packages you do not need, removing them lowers the total image size. For example, consider removing luci-ssl or other heavier packages that might not be strictly necessary.

- Swap or Reduce Package Variants  
Replace heavier variants of packages with lighter ones. For instance, go from wpad-wolfssl to wpad-basic-wolfssl or wpad-mini if your use case allows it.

- Optimize Your Go Module  
You might build the module with minimal dependencies:
  
  - Statically compile with CGO disabled:  
    (in your Go project)  
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=mips CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w"  
  - This helps strip debugging symbols and reduce size.

- Increase the Flash Partition (If Possible)  
In some cases, you can adjust the partition size (depending on device), but this is often limited by the hardware layout.

- Use External Storage  
If the device supports USB or microSD expansions, install non-essential packages externally rather than in flash (this depends on your environment and device capabilities).

By trying one or more of these steps, you should be able to reduce the total firmware size and successfully include the whoami module for your GL-AR300M16.
