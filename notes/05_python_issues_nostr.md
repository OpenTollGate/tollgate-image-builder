Based on the error messages, you're trying to install the `nostr` Python package on a Debian-based system that uses external environment management. Here's how to fix this properly using a virtual environment:

1. First, make sure you have python3-full and python3-venv installed:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-full python3-venv
```

2. Create a virtual environment in your project directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Now install the nostr package in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install nostr
```

5. After installation, you'll need to run your script using the Python interpreter from the virtual environment. Either:
   - Keep the virtual environment activated and run your script normally, or
   - Use the full path to the virtual environment's Python interpreter:

```bash
./venv/bin/python blossom_download.py
```

Alternatively, if you really need to install it system-wide (not recommended), you can force it with:

```bash
sudo pip3 install --break-system-packages nostr
```

However, the virtual environment approach is the recommended way as it:
- Keeps your system Python clean
- Prevents conflicts between different projects
- Makes your project more portable
- Follows Python best practices

The virtual environment approach is safer and more maintainable in the long run.
